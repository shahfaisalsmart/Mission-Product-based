    cin.tie(nullptr);
    cout.tie(nullptr);
    int n,m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    if(m==0|| m==1){
        cout<<"1"<<endl;return 0;}
    if(n==m){
        cout<<"0"<<endl;
        return 0;
    }
    
    if(m>1)
    {
        if(n%2==0)
        {
            if(m <= (n/2))
                cout<<m<<endl;
            else
                cout<<n-m<<endl;
        }
        else{
            if(m < n/2)
                cout<<m<<endl;
            else if(m==n/2 || m==(n/2)+1)
                cout<<n/2;
            else
                cout<<n-m<<endl;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
