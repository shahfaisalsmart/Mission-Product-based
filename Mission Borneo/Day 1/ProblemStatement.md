## 1. Pair Sum

Take as input N, the size of array. Take N more distinct inputs and store that in an array. Take as input “target”, a number. 
Write a function which prints all pairs of numbers which sum to target.

> This question was asked in initial rounds of Google interview.

### Constraint: 
```bash
Length of the arrays should be between 1 and 1000.
```

### Input Format
```bash
The first line of input contains an integer, N, which denotes the size of the array. 
The following N lines of input contains N integers.
The following line contains a integer, that denotes the target number. 
```

### Output Format
```
Print all pair of elements in the array which has sum equal to target element.
```

### Sample Input 1
```bash
5
1
3
4
2
5
5
```
### Sample Output 1
```bash
1 and 4
2 and 3
```
### Sample Input 2
```bash
4
10
15
3
7
17
```
### Sample Output 2
```bash
10 and 7
```
### Code in C++
```bash

## 2. Missing Positive Integer
Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should give 2. The input [1, 2, 0] should give 3.
You can modify the input array in-place.

### Constraint: 
```bash
Time Limit: 1 second
```

### Input Format
```bash
The first line of input contains an integer: N, which denotes the size of the array. 
The following line contains N space separated integers. 
```

### Output Format
```
Print the missing positive integer, as described in the task.
```

### Sample Input 1
```bash
4
3  4 -1 1
```
### Sample Output 1
```bash
2
```
